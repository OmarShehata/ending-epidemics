	<blockquote>You and I may not live to see the day, and my name may be forgotten when it comes; but the time will arrive when great outbreaks of cholera will be things of the past; and it is the <b>knowledge of the way in which the disease is propagated</b> which will cause them to disappear.<cite>John Snow (1854)</cite></blockquote>
	<p>This is an unusually prescient quote. The English physician John Snow indeed never lived to see the day, but we no longer have great outbreaks of cholera. He was also right about how we eradicated it - it wasn't the discovery of a new medicine or even knowledge of the disease itself. We conquered cholera once we understood how it spread.</p>
	<p>That we would one day overcome cholera was not something most people at the time believed. No one understood what caused it, theories proliferated, and it seemed inevitable that large dense cities would succumb to these deadly outbreaks (in the same way that most people accept traffic jams as a feature of large modern cities).</p>
	<p>The reason so many great minds were confounded by cholera was because of the scale of the problem. The bacteria were too small to see & the infection patterns too large for any one doctor to detect. It is precisely when human intuition fails that mathematical models expose such valuable insight. </p>
	<p>Our goal is to develop a mathematical model that will allow us to understand the complex dynamics of disease in society. Let's see how many lives we can save.</p>

	<p>[Explain the situation in London. No toilets. Lots of cesspools, terrible smells, cramped living conditions, poverty. The cholera hits. What do we do? The obvious culrprit is the miasma. In fact, let's verify this with some data]</p>
	<p><i>[A table of data about incidences of Cholera with the factors of smell/miasma]</i></p>
	<p>[If it seems like miasma really is the cause from just scanning this table, then you've reached the same conclusion as the department of health. Unfourtunately, this caused much death. Any reasonable person would have come to the same conclusion. There wasn't enough data.]</p>
	<p>[Herein lies an important insight: these models are kind of useless without good data.]</p>

	<p>[I want to start not with introducing SIR, but with the open question, how do we model the spread of a disease?]
