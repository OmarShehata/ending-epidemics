	<p>[<b>Introduction</b>. Something to excite the reader and explain the intended audience. Maybe something like: Outbreaks of deadly disease are not a thing of the past. Ebola, Zika, and measles continue to threaten the lives of millions in many parts of the world. These diseases march & grip lives faster than we can move. In 1854 London was struggling with a deadly outbreak of Cholera. In an effort to rid the city of the disease, the department of health ended up creating the best conditions for Cholera to thrive, unleashing a deadly outbreak. They couldn't see the disease because they didn't have the tools. Trusting the maths is what allowed us to finally rid the world of Cholera. And that's the whole point - we construct models to gain insights to things we cannot otherwise see or understand.]</p>
	<p>[We're going to see just how many lives we could save with these mathematical models.]</p>

	<p>[Explain the situation in London. No toilets. Lots of cesspools, terrible smells, cramped living conditions, poverty. The cholera hits. What do we do? The obvious culrprit is the miasma. In fact, let's verify this with some data]</p>
	<p><i>[A table of data about incidences of Cholera with the factors of smell/miasma]</i></p>
	<p>[If it seems like miasma really is the cause from just scanning this table, then you've reached the same conclusion as the department of health. Unfourtunately, this caused much death. Any reasonable person would have come to the same conclusion. There wasn't enough data.]</p>
	<p>[Herein lies an important insight: these models are kind of useless without good data.]</p>

	<p>[I want to start not with introducing SIR, but with the open question, how do we model the spread of a disease?]
